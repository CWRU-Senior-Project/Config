Problem encountered while attempting to make Config v1:

SDF xml format was assumed to be governed by an XSD, but instead each module in gazebo uses their own variant of the SDF which is generated and checked programatically. A full list of the hierarchy is available online which amounts to about 40 pages of text.

An attempt to generate a basic XSD will be made in the future.
